        There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a Function Expression.

            alert( "Hello" );
        };
    

    /**         Function is a value             **/

        // no matter how the function is created, a function is a value. Both examples above store a function in the sayHi variable.

            }

            // The code above shows its string representation, which is the source code.
            // Surely, a function is a special value, in the sense that we can call it like sayHi().


            // We can copy a function to another variable:
                function sayHi() {   // (1) create
                    alert( "Hello" );
                }

                func(); // Hello     // (3) run the copy (it works)!
                sayHi(); // Hello    //     this still works too (why wouldn't it)

    /**     Callback functions          **/

        // passing functions as values and using function expressions.

        // We’ll write a function ask(question, yes, no) with three parameters:
            function ask(question, yes, no) {
                if (confirm(question)) yes()
                else no();

            }
            
            // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
            ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);

            // Note---> The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.

            // The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.

        // We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:
            function ask(question, yes, no) {
                if (confirm(question)) yes()
                else no();
            }
            
            ask(
                "Do you agree?",
                function() { alert("You agreed."); },
                function() { alert("You canceled the execution."); }
            );

            // functions are declared right inside the ask(...) call. They have no name, and so are called anonymous. Such functions are not accessible outside of ask (because they are not assigned to variables), but that’s just what we want here.

        // The correct approach would be to use a Function Expression and assign welcome to the variable that is declared outside of if and has the proper visibility.
