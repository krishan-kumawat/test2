    /**
        The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks ??.
        As it treats null and undefined similarly, we’ll use a special term here, in this article. For brevity, we’ll say that a value is “defined” when it’s neither null nor undefined.

        The result of a ?? b is:
           1. if a is defined, then a,
           2. if a isn’t defined, then b.
        
        Note :  The common use case for ?? is to provide a default value.
    **/

    let user;
    alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user is undefined)

    user = "John";
    alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // John (user is not null/udefined)


    let firstName = null;
    let lastName = null;
    let nickName = "Supercoder";

    // shows the first defined value:
    alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder

    /********   Comparison with ||  *********/

    let height = 0;
    alert(height || 100); // 100
    alert(height ?? 100); // 0

    /*
        Precedence
            The precedence of the ?? operator is the same as ||. They both equal 3 in the MDN table.
    */

   // That means that, just like ||, the nullish coalescing operator ?? is evaluated before = and ?, but after most other operations, such as +, *.

        height = null;
        let width = null;
        // important: use parentheses
        let area = (height ?? 100) * (width ?? 50);
        alert(area); // 5000


    // Due to safety reasons, JavaScript forbids using ?? together with && and || operators, unless the precedence is explicitly specified with parentheses.
        let x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error


        let k = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works
        alert(k); // 2
